<h1 align="center">Smart Timestamps for your FlowLauncher</h1>

<p align="center">Generate smart timestamps, look up dates, and copy them to your clipboard, using natural language in the FlowLauncher. <br> 
  Most copy options will copy plain text (strings) to your clipboard, the last option does provides the date in the UNIX format. <br>

<p align="center">Unlock and change the output to your liking by going to the folder 'build' -> 'index.js'.  <br> <br> </center>
This plugin is a standalone extension of the original "Discord Timestamps" plugin by <a href="https://github.com/Jessuhh/discord-timestamps-flowlauncher-plugin">Jesse</a>, allowing you to copy the outputs in both natural language or in UNIX format.
If you are only interested in the UNIX syntax, check out Jesse`s <a href="https://github.com/Jessuhh/discord-timestamps-flowlauncher-plugin">Discord Timestamps</a> or uncomment the code in the index.js file.  </p>

## How to use 
Type `ts` and enter a timepoint you are interested in. Click or press enter, or use the Alt + {Number} Shortcut, to copy the timestamp to your clipboard. <br>
The Gif above shows some use cases. If you only type `ts`, you will get the current date and time (minutes are rounded). <br>
You don't need to write out each complete date. `22/04/24 2 PM` or `22/04/24 14:00` is equal to `22/4 14` (assuming 2024 is the current year). <br> And `in 15 hours 7 minutes 240 seconds` would be equal to `in 15h 7min 240sec` for example.


### Where to get the Plugin

You can find this plugin in the [Flow Launcher's](https://www.flowlauncher.com/) Plugin Store, or by running the following command in your FlowLauncher:
